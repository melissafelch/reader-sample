Reliving embarrassing memories for the sake of fun!

# Welcome to my code sample!
This is a fun little project I wrote originally perhaps 10 years ago. 
It's been in the back of my mind to try rewriting it in react - an online reader seems perfectly suited to that!
The contents are a little embarrassing, so please don't judge me too harshly. It was a different time!

I also created an API for giggles... until it turned out that the web host I generally use does not allow node! 

For the sake of the code sample, I limited myself to working on this over the course of two days, 
so functionally the gui is limited to a series index and table of contents view for said series. 

Enough digression, back to the node conundrum! 
Because there's no other way to access the data on the server, the API has been designed for local execution. Unfortunately, this means no MYSQL access without whitelisting... so if you'd like to see this bad boy in action, please let me know! 

## Getting started
The project is segregated into two parts - the API and the App folder. Once the repository is cloned, run "npm i" and "npm start" in each of those two directories
to get started. This isn't quite optimized for production, but hopefully it gets the point across!

## Thank you for taking a look!
